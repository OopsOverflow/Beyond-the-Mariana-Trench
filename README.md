# Beyond-the-Mariana-Trench
Research Project
• Developed algorithms capable of analyzing large chunks of data to study the depth profile of the
Mariana trench.
• Helped implement AI and machine learning algorithms to identify rare minerals based on the
depth profiles and sedimentation coefficients.
